# Investigating the Impact of Poverty and Population on Gun Violence Rates.

## Introduction.
Gun violence remains a major public health issue in the United States. While various factors contribute to it, economic and demographic indicators such as poverty and population density are consistently suspected to be influential. This report aims to explore the relationship between poverty levels, population characteristics, and the prevalence of gun violence across U.S. states over time.

Our data sources include:

1. American Community Survey (ACS)- contains ACS estimates for U.S. states, including population, income, poverty rates, and demographic characteristics -,

2.Gun violence data -Provides gun violence incidents by state and date.

This analysis was conducted using R and Quarto, incorporating visualization, statistical testing, and reproducible data science practices.

## Source
Data was obtained via the tidycensus R package and the United States Census website.

### Lollipop plot to explore ACS data for missingness.
```{r}

labs(caption = "Source: American Community Survey via tidycensus")
```
The dataset has no missing values.

# To check for missingness in the second dataset. 
```{r}

```

### Plotting a lollipop plot to explore missingness
```{r}
gg_miss_var(gun_violence, show_pct = TRUE) +
  labs(caption = "Source: Gun Violence Archive")
```
While the majority of the dataset was complete, we did observe missing values in certain descriptive fields of the gun violence data, notably business_or_school, county, and address. This missingness does not affect the calculation of core metrics like gun violence rates or their relationship with poverty which are the main focus of our analysis.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

Lets explore the summary statistics
```{r}
# summarizing mean of the median_income from the year 2014-2023 by county_state.
us_data |>
  filter(year >= 2014, year <= 2023) |>
  group_by(year, county_state) |>
  summarize(average_median_income =  round(mean(median_income, na.rm = TRUE))) |>
  arrange(desc(average_median_income)) |>
  ungroup() |>
  slice_head(n = 10) |>
  flextable() |>
  colformat_double(big.mark = "", digits = 0) |>
  theme_zebra() |>
  add_header_lines("Table 1: Top 10 states by Average median income, 2014–2023")
```

Next we can check the sample size of the population its mean and standard deviation per year.
```{r}
# Summarizing sample size of the population its mean and standard deviation per year.
summary_stat <- us_data |>
  group_by(year) |> # Groups the data by year.
  summarize(pop_mean =  mean(population, na.rm = TRUE), # Calculates the mean population for each year.
            pop_size = n(), # Counts the number of entries in states per year.
            pop_sd = round(sd(population, na.rm = TRUE))) |> # Calculates and rounds the standard deviation of pouplation per year.
  ungroup() |>
  slice_head(n = 10)
  
# Create a flextable for the summary statistics
flextable(summary_stat) |>
   colformat_double(big.mark = "", digits = 0) |>
  add_header_lines("Table 2: Summary statistics over the years") |>
  theme_vanilla()
  
```
This table summarizes the average state-level population statistics from 2008 to 2017.These values reflect state-level averages whereby the mean population represents the average population across 52 U.S. states and territories each year, while the standard deviation shows the variation in population sizes across them.

```
:::
The line graph illustrates Michigan’s socioeconomic evolution from 2008 to 2023, with rising median income signaling economic progress and fluctuating poverty rates highlighting persistent challenges. The inverse relationship between these metrics suggests that economic growth alone doesn’t eliminate poverty, which may contribute to social issues like gun violence.

# Exploratory data analysis and data cleaning for the second dataset.
The code snippet transforms the gun_violence dataset by converting the `date` column to a `Date` object and creating new columns (day, year, month) using lubridate functions. This enables temporal aggregation and analysis, supporting visualizations (e.g., calendar heatmap, yearly heatmap) and data merging with ACS data. It’s a critical preprocessing step that ensures the dataset is ready for the project’s statistical and visual analyses, directly contributing to insights about gun violence patterns and their socioeconomic drivers.


```{r}
# Aggregating data.
gun_violence <- gun_violence |>
  mutate(date = ymd(date), # Changing the data variable to a date type variable.
         day = day(date),
         year = year(date), 
         month = month(date, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE))  # extracting the day, year and month.

This provides strong evidence that poverty rates and gun violence rates are meaningfully related in our dataset, suggesting that socioeconomic factors may play an important role in explaining variations in gun violence across different areas.

Randomization of pop_gunviolence data.
```{r}

      mutate(population = sample(population))
    randomized_correlations[i] <- cor(randomized_data$population, randomized_data$gun_violence_rate)

The permutation test results show a weak negative correlation (-0.052) between population and gun violence rate, with a p-value of 0.259. The visualization displays the null distribution of correlations that would occur by random chance, with our observed correlation (red dashed line) falling within this distribution. Since the p-value exceeds the conventional threshold of 0.05. This indicates that population alone may not be a reliable predictor of gun violence rates.

### Permutation test for Categorical variables.
Creating a new variable `poverty_group by splitting area by median poverty rate.
```{r}
pop_gunviolence <- pop_gunviolence |>
  mutate(poverty_group = ifelse(prop_poverty > median(prop_poverty, na.rm = TRUE),
                                "High Poverty", "Low Poverty"))
```

Creating a density plot to check for skewness and normality.

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
ggplot(pop_gunviolence, aes(x = gun_violence_rate, fill = poverty_group)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
   scale_fill_manual(values = c("High Poverty" = "#e63946", "Low Poverty" = "#457b9d")) +

# Two-sample t-test
Next, we state the hypotheses and implement Welch’s two-sample t-test to test whether the average gun violence rate is different between high poverty and low poverty areas.
$$ H_0: \mu_{\text{High}} = \mu_{\text{Low}}  $$
$$ H_a: \mu_{\text{High}} = \mu_{\text{Low}}  $$
where $\mu_{\text{High}}$ is the average gun violence rate in high poverty areas., and $\mu_{\text{Low}}$ is the average gun violence rate in low poverty areas.

```{r}
# Reorder factor levels for t-test
pop_gunviolence <- pop_gunviolence |>
  dplyr::mutate(poverty_group = fct_relevel(poverty_group, "High Poverty", "Low Poverty"))


t_test_result <- t.test(gun_violence_rate ~ poverty_group, data = pop_gunviolence)

# Display results of t-test
t_test_result |> 
  broom::tidy() |> 
  flextable() |> 
  colformat_double(digits = 3) |> 
set_formatter(p.value = function(x) {format.pval(x, digits = 3)}) |> 
  set_caption("Table 4: Results of two-sample t-test comparing gun violence rates between high and low poverty areas.") |> 
  autofit() |> 
  fit_to_width(max_width = 7)
```
We observed high positive skewness in the gun violence rate variable, particularly in the High Poverty group. Given the violation of the normality assumption required for the t-test, we proceeded with a non-parametric permutation test to assess the difference in means, which does not rely on distributional assumptions.

```{r}
# Calculating standard deviations and variances for each group
pop_gunviolence |>
  group_by(poverty_group) |>
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    Mean = mean(gun_violence_rate, na.rm = TRUE),
    SD = sd(gun_violence_rate, na.rm = TRUE),
    Var = var(gun_violence_rate, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
    
flextable() |> 
  colformat_double(digits = 3) |> 
  set_caption("Table 5: Summary statistics of gun violence rate by poverty group") |>
  autofit()
  
```
The standard deviation of gun violence rates in the High Poverty group was 210.82, compared to 38.55 in the Low Poverty group. This indicates higher variability in one group. The difference in variance supports the use of Welch’s t-test, which does not assume equal variances between groups.


```{r}
# Number of permutations to do
n_permutations <- 10000

# Instantiating vector for test statistics
permutation_statistics <- vector(length = n_permutations)

# Calculating t-test statistic for each permutation
for (p in 1:n_permutations) {
  permuted_data <- pop_gunviolence |> 
    mutate(poverty_group = sample(poverty_group, replace = FALSE))  # Shuffle group labels
  
  permutation_statistics[p] <- t.test(gun_violence_rate ~ poverty_group, 
                                      data = permuted_data,
                                      alternative = "greater") |> 
    broom::tidy() |> 
    pull(statistic)
}

```

Create a histogram displaying the null distribution obtained for the randomization test, similar to the visualization below. What is the distribution centered at?
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
# Organizing into a tibble
computed_statistics <- tibble(Value = permutation_statistics)

# Creating a histogram.
computed_statistics |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Value)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y= after_stat(density)), color = "white") +
  geom_density(color = "turquoise", linewidth = 1) +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) dt(x, df = t_test_result$parameter),color = "violet",linewidth = 1) +
  labs(title = "Randomization null distribution",
       caption = "Fig 7: Null distribution of Permutation Correlations") +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.1))) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = quantile(permutation_statistics, probs = 0.95), color = "red", linetype = "solid") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = t_test_result$statistic, color= "blue",linetype = "dotted")
```
:::
The distribution is approximately centered at zero, consistent with the null hypothesis of no group difference. The blue dotted line shows the observed *t*-statistic, while the red solid line marks the 95th percentile of the null distribution. If the observed statistic lies beyond this threshold, it provides evidence against the null hypothesis.
